This repository contains the source code used for *An Exploratory Mixed-Methods
Study of Deep Neural Network Reuse in Computational Natural Science*. If you are
looking for the data used in the study, we have released our SQLite3 database
and author agreement excel workbooks to Zenodo.

## About

This repository contains the source code to automatically search and filter for
Natural Science publications from Nature, PLOS, and Science using OpenAlex. It
also includes all of our code to capture and parse the metadata, as well as bulk
download open-access articles from Nature and PLOS. Finally, it also includes
the code to run an automated analysis of our study on arbiturary papers using
pre-trained foundational reasoning and non-reasoning large language models
(LLMs) via Ollama. We have provided a runner script to execute all autonomous
operations and figure generations of our work. For the manual review portions of
study, we have released a template Excel (.xlsx) workbook and instructions on
how to perform our author agreement process.
